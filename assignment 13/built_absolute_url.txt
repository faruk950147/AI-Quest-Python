1. Relative URL

A Relative URL is a URL that specifies the path to a page on the website without including the domain name.

It only tells the browser where the page is within the site.

Example:

/about/


Suppose your website is https://www.example.com

This relative URL points to: https://www.example.com/about/

But if you only write /about/, the browser doesn’t know the domain, so it’s relative.

2. Absolute URL

An Absolute URL is a full URL, including the protocol (http/https) and domain name.

It tells exactly where to go, so it works anywhere, like in emails or other websites.

Example:

https://www.example.com/about/


Here, https://www.example.com + /about/ → full address

This is an absolute URL because it explicitly states the complete location.
